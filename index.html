  <h1>Leafline NGO Proposal</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>South Africa faces a youth employment crisis of historic proportions... Leafline was founded to meet this challenge... Together we can turn despair into purpose for South Africa’s next generation.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Background and Context</h2>
    <p>South Africa’s youth unemployment rate is among the highest in the world... This vacuum – between existing training programs and the real, human needs of job-seekers – is exactly where Leafline steps in.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Vision and Mission of Leafline</h2>
    <p>Leafline envisions a South Africa where every young person... In all our work, Leafline’s values are clear: hope, dignity and purpose.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How Leafline Works</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>WhatsApp Sign-up:</strong> Young people join by messaging Leafline...</li>
      <li><strong>Guided Questions:</strong> A Leafline facilitator chats with the youth...</li>
      <li><strong>Skill Mining:</strong> From the conversation we identify hidden assets...</li>
      <li><strong>Personalized CV Building:</strong> We then rewrite or reorganize the CV...</li>
      <li><strong>Empowerment Conversation:</strong> Beyond the CV, every Leafline session is also a mentoring moment...</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Leafline Difference</h2>
    <p>Leafline stands apart because we treat unemployed youth as whole human beings... Leafline provides more than just a better CV – we offer renewed hope and purpose.</p>
