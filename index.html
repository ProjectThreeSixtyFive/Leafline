      <h2>About us</h2>
      <p>South Africa faces a youth employment crisis of historic proportions. Recent data show roughly 44–46% of young people (ages 16–34) are jobless – and an astonishing 59.6% of those aged 16–24. This is far above the global youth unemployment rate (about 13% worldwide) and translates to millions of talented young South Africans unable to find work. The consequences go beyond economics: years of rejection and idleness leave many youth depressed, anxious and feeling hopeless. Society currently lacks a coordinated plan to address this human crisis – even a presidential commission has warned that youth joblessness above 50% is a “national crisis” demanding innovative, urgent solutions. 
      <a href="https://www.statssa.gov.za/?p=16780" target="_blank">[Source]</a></p>

      <p>Leafline was founded to meet this challenge. We are a youth-focused NGO operating on WhatsApp, where young people literally text us their CVs. Through guided conversations and smart questioning, Leafline uncovers each candidate’s hidden skills and life experiences – those personal stories often missing from ordinary resumes. Our team then transforms their CVs and profiles, showcasing strengths (resilience, leadership in adversity, community service, etc.) that restore confidence and purpose. In doing so, we help rebuild dignity and hope in every young person we serve. 
      <a href="https://www.unicef.org/southafrica/press-releases/unicef-launches-report-adolescents-mental-health" target="_blank">[Source]</a></p>

      <p>This outlines Leafline’s vision and methods. It shows how, by combining simple technology with a deeply human approach, we can turn statistics into real young lives transformed. We invite government, funders and partners to join us: together we can turn despair into purpose for South Africa’s next generation.

    <section class="background-context">
      <h2>Background and Context</h2>
      <p>South Africa’s youth unemployment rate is among the highest in the world. Official statistics show 45.5% of South Africans aged 15–34 were unemployed in early 2024, compared to a national average of 32.9%. By the end of 2024, it was still roughly 44.6%. For the youngest cohort the situation is even more severe: about 59.6% of 15–24 year-olds are without work. In absolute terms this means roughly 4.7 million young South Africans were seeking jobs at the close of 2024. These figures dwarf the global youth average (about 13% in 2023) and signal a major national emergency. 
      <a href="https://businesstech.co.za/news/government/744968/the-real-youth-unemployment-rate-in-south-africa/" target="_blank">[Source]</a></p>

      <p>The human impact of such high unemployment is grave. Studies in South Africa have documented that unemployed youth report feelings of boredom, emptiness and uncertainty about the future. Psychological research confirms that joblessness often leads to depression, anxiety, anger, despair and social isolation, along with a steep decline in self-esteem and life satisfaction. Prolonged unemployment can erode skills and the very sense of identity of a young person. In community surveys, many young people say their biggest worries are lack of opportunity and the resulting hopelessness; UNICEF reports show 60% of youth want mental-health support because anxiety about their future is so high. 
      <a href="https://www.unicef.org/southafrica/reports/mental-health-and-well-being-adolescents-south-africa" target="_blank">[Source]</a></p>

      <p>Meanwhile, there is no single comprehensive solution in place. Government has launched programs (for example, the Presidential Youth Employment Initiative) recognizing the crisis, even declaring youth joblessness above 50% a “national crisis” requiring a coordinated plan. But despite policy efforts, unemployment has actually worsened over the past decade. The lack of technical skills and work experience among youth has been widely discussed, yet little attention has been paid to the emotional and life-skill gaps these young people face. In practice, many youth fall through the cracks: they submit CVs to formal job portals or agencies and hear nothing back, with no one to coach them or help them market their own value. This vacuum – between existing training programs and the real, human needs of job-seekers – is exactly where Leafline steps in.

    <section class="vision-mission">
      <h2>Our Vision and Mission</h2>
      <p>Leafline envisions a South Africa where every young person, no matter their background, is seen for the unique strengths they bring to the world. We believe that “meaningful employment… fosters human dignity” and empowers youth to shape their own futures. Our mission is to make this a reality. Leafline helps young South Africans rediscover their agency and worth by transforming how they tell their own story. We do this by going beyond check-box training or generic CV templates: instead, we listen to each youth’s life experience and uncover the strengths hidden in it. 
      <a href="https://www.undp.org/blog/human-dignity-comes-jobs" target="_blank">[Source]</a></p>

      <p>Founded as a personal passion project by a former teacher, Leafline is built to scale. We operate like a family: every volunteer or staff member treats the youth we help with respect and care. At the same time, we maintain a clear, scalable structure: a simple tech platform on WhatsApp connects us to young people nationwide, and a trained team of facilitators applies our process consistently. We are also outward-looking – partnering with local businesses and community groups to multiply our impact. In all our work, Leafline’s values are clear: hope, dignity and purpose. These guide every step, from how we write a resume to how we coach a teenager to fill out a diary or manage a small budget.</p>

    <section class="how-it-works">
      <h2>How Leafline Works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>WhatsApp Sign-up:</strong> Young people join by messaging Leafline on WhatsApp. We keep a waitlist for new applicants so no one is lost. Each candidate sends us their current CV or a brief introduction.</li>
        <li><strong>Guided Questions:</strong> A Leafline facilitator chats with the youth (in their home language if needed), asking about all aspects of their life – schooling, family roles, volunteering, hobbies, talents and even challenges they have overcome.</li>
        <li><strong>Skill Mining:</strong> From the conversation we identify hidden assets – transferable life skills and concrete experiences.</li>
        <li><strong>Personalized CV Building:</strong> We rewrite or reorganize the CV, using plain language and examples. The result is a resume that highlights the candidate’s story and value.</li>
        <li><strong>Empowerment Conversation:</strong> Every session ends with mentoring – celebrating small wins, encouraging next steps, and restoring a sense of hope.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="leafline-difference">
      <h2>The Leafline Difference</h2>
      <p>Leafline stands apart because we treat unemployed youth as whole human beings, not just numbers. Many programs help young people gain skills, but few address the deep sense of failure that unemployment can create. We do. Our philosophy is: healing hope leads to real results. As one UN report highlights, jobs are not only about income but about restoring human dignity.
      <a href="https://www.undp.org/blog/human-dignity-comes-jobs" target="_blank">[Source]</a></p>

      <p>Concretely, our difference is the emotional support woven into every interaction. Instead of asking “Do you have any work experience?”, we ask, “What are you proud of doing outside of school?” This shift opens up strength-based responses. By the end, youth often say, “I didn’t realize this was important,” or “Thank you, I needed to hear that.”</p>

    <section class="call-to-action">
      <h2>Conclusion and Call to Action</h2>
      <p>South Africa’s future depends on its youth – yet too many young people are slipping into discouragement and desperation. Leafline offers a visionary but practical solution: empower youth one-by-one with the personal attention and skills they need. We know this works because even small changes – a rewritten resume, a supportive conversation, a taught life skill – have a ripple effect. 
      <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/youth-employment/lang--en/index.htm" target="_blank">[Source]</a></p>

      <p>We invite funders, government agencies, businesses and civil society leaders to partner with Leafline. Your support can help us scale our WhatsApp coaching platform nationwide, train more facilitators from local communities, and deepen our partnerships. Join us, and let’s give South Africa’s young people the second chance they deserve.</p>
