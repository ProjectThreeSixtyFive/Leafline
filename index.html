      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>South Africa is facing one of the most serious unemployment crises globally, with youth bearing the brunt of the economic instability. The official unemployment rate, according to Statistics South Africa, decreased slightly by 0.8 percentage points from 32.9% in Q3 2023 to 32.1% in Q4 2023. However, the expanded definition of unemployment — which includes discouraged work-seekers — shows a marginal decrease from 41.1% to 40.4%, highlighting a continued crisis of opportunity and systemic inequality.</p>

      <p>While small improvements are noted, the overall levels remain dangerously high, particularly among young people aged 15–34, who make up a significant percentage of the unemployed population. This demographic continues to face major challenges, leading to increased social instability and mental health issues. In a third-world country like South Africa, the combination of unemployment and poverty is fueling hopelessness, eroding confidence, and damaging the sense of purpose in young people at an alarming rate.</p>

      <p>Job instability and lack of opportunities are directly contributing to the mental health crisis. Individuals are losing hope in the traditional pathways of “study hard, find a job,” because despite qualifications, the employment market cannot absorb the numbers. Desperation and uncertainty are becoming the norm, threatening both the social and economic fabric of the country.</p>

      <p>LeafLine exists as a response to this reality. We aim to create bridges where walls exist — providing education, training, mentorship, and support structures that reignite the purpose, vision, and hope of South Africa’s youth. Our vision is to empower a generation that does not simply accept the status quo, but actively reshapes it for a better tomorrow.</p>
